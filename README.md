#### Business Problem
AdventureWorks needed a scalable BI solution to track company performance and support efficient decision-making. Key challenges include visualizing multi-million-dollar revenue figures and monitoring product-level orders in the tens of thousands—both of which directly inform sales, marketing, and operations.

#### Goal of the Dashboard
To empower business users to answer high-impact questions quickly, such as:
- “Which product line contributed most to last year’s $24.9M revenue?”
- “Where did returns exceed the average rate of 2.17%, and why?”
- “Who are our top customers among the 17,400 unique buyers, and how much did each segment spend?”
